# SwiftNavigation

## Goal

Add and enhance SwiftUI-inspired state-driven navigation to Swift apps using the [SwiftNavigation] library. Use this skill to simplify SwiftUI presentations, UIKit navigation and presentation, and even introduce SwiftUI-like navigation patterns to third party platforms, like Android and Wasm.

[SwiftNavigation]: http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-navigation

## Related skills

Always consult the `pfw-case-paths/SKILL.md` skill when implementing enum navigation patterns.

## Quick start

1. Use `pfw-spm/SKILL.md` skill to correctly edit Package.swift.
1. Add the `https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-navigation` package dependency from `2.0.0` or newer.
2. Add the appropriate product to your target's dependencies:
    * `SwiftUINavigation`: Additional navigation helpers for SwiftUI (see `references/swiftui-navigation.md`).
    * `UIKitNavigation`: SwiftUI-like navigation APIs for UIKit (see `references/uikit-navigation.md`).
    * `SwiftNavigation`: (less common) General-purpose navigation APIs that can be leveraged on other platforms, like SwiftWasm, Android, and Windows (see `references/swift-navigation.md`).
3. Import the appropriate product module (`SwiftUINavigation` or `UIKitNavigation`, or `SwiftNavigation`)

## API interface

Full API interface for when solution can't be found elsewhere:

* SwiftUI navigation extensions: `references/interface/SwiftUINavigation.swiftinterface`
* SwiftUI-like navigation APIs for UIKit: `references/interface/UIKitNavigation.swiftinterface`
* General-purpose navigation APIs that can be leveraged on other platforms, like SwiftWasm, Android, and Windows: `references/interface/SwiftNavigation.swiftinterface`
